# Flight Delay Model Implementation

## Overview
This project aims to predict the arrival delay of airlines using the model trained on XGBoost classifier. The project utilizes XGBoost's powerful gradient boosting algorithms for predictive modeling.
The user will enter the Flight name,Destination airport,origin airport,scheduled arrival and departure times to get the probabilities of their flight being delayed.This model will predict the delay and gives us the probabilities for 5 classes-(No Delay,Short Delay,Medium Delay,Long Delay,Very Long Delay)
## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation with metrics
- Visualization of feature importance

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. Install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
